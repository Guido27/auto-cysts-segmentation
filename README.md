## Abstract
Currently affecting about 12.4 million people worldwide, Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a major life-threatening genetically inherited human disease and the most common hereditary kidney pathology, marked by the progressive growth of renal cysts. No cure is known for ADPKD, and even pharmacological treatment options are quite limited, and just mitigating and slowing the progression of the pathology. In fact, clinically available and experimental drugs currently target the characterizing phenotypes of the disease, namely, the number and the size of cysts, aiming at limiting both these factors.
Thus, automating detection and evolution of cysts' features is a critical step in the novel drug development process. Artificial Intelligence methods and, in particular, Deep Learning algorithms can provide powerful and effective solutions for such task, and different architectures have indeed been proposed in the literature in the last few years. Here we comparatively review some of the aforementioned alternative segmentation processes, using as a testbed a suite of original RGB sequential immunofluorescence images from 4 \textit{in vitro} experiments employing 32 kidney tubules. To reach a deeper understanding of the detection process, we specialize the performance metrics used for the algorithms' evaluation at both the pixel and the cyst level. Overall, two architectures stand out as best performing, namely UNet++ and UACANet: the latter, in particular, employs a self-attention mechanism introducing some explainability aspects to be further exploited in future developments, thus making it the more promising algorithms to build upon towards a more refined cysts detection platform.
